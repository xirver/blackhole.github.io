# About Me

Hi, Iâ€™m **Federico**, a cybersecurity enthusiast and CTF player.  
I love breaking things (legally ðŸ˜…), especially through web exploitation, reverse engineering, and pwning challenges.  

When Iâ€™m not hacking away at CTFs, youâ€™ll usually find me deep into **video games** or catching up on **manga**.  
Basically, if Iâ€™m not popping shells, Iâ€™m probably grinding levels or reading some "japanese comics" as someone would say.  

This blog is my little corner of the internet where I share writeups, tips, and random notes from my CTF journey.
